# Mining_Game

A simple game that I created for my stepdad (who works as a geologist) for his birthday when I was around 12.

Controls:
-"M" recruits a miner that brings you one or more rocks as gifts <br/>
-"G" accepts queued gifts from miners <br/>
-"H" hides your pickaxe so you can purchase upgrades <br/>
